# PS3NeuralNetHousePrice

#Note
- I had issues coding in the PS3 codespace so I created a new codespace
- when I commited the work from the new code space, I realized it did not commit to the homework submission
- so I have copied the code from the new code space to the HW submission one and commited
- the code should run on your end to provide the output 'predictions.csv' as it did in the new codespace
